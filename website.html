    <h2>What is Front-end development?</h2>
        <p>Front-end web development is the development of the graphical 
        user interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and 
        JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website.
        </p>

<div id="overview">
    <h2>What does a Front-end Developer do?</h2>
        <p>A frontend developer is in charge of executing design and content 
        directions through code. These developers enable interfaces to look 
        pleasing on all devices â€” phones, tablets, and computers. 
        Frontend developers aim to provide the best user experience for customers 
        and ensure that the overall software layout is consistent.
        </p>


<h2>Programming Languages for Front-end Developers</h2>
    <p>To develop client-facing sections of the software, a developer needs 
    to be familiar with these three main languages:
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
