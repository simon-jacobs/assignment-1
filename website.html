<h1>Front-End Web Development</h1>
<br><br>

<div id="introduction">
    <h2>What is Front-end development?</h2>
    <p id="first-paragraph">Front-end web development is the development of the graphical 
    user interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and 
    JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="overview">
    <h2>What does a Front-End Developer do?</h2>
    <p id="second-paragraph"><b>A front-end developer</b> is in charge of executing design and content 
    directions through code. These developers enable interfaces to look 
    pleasing on all devices — phones, tablets, and computers. 
    Frontend developers aim to provide the best user experience for customers 
    and ensure that the overall software layout is consistent.
    </p>

<h2>Programming Languages for Front-End Developers</h2>
<p id="third-paragraph"><b>To develop</b> client-facing sections of the software, a developer needs 
    to be familiar with these <em>three</em> main languages:
</p>
    <ul>
        <b><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a></li></b>
        <b><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a></li></b>
        <b><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a></li></b>
    </ul>

<h2>Why Front-end development is important</h2>
<p id="fourth-paragraph"><b>As more businesses</b> compete for customers attention, the ability to stand out among 
similar organizations is essential to a company's success. Front-end development 
activities result in the first touchpoints for many clients or customers and can 
be the determining factor in organizational performance. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="challenges">
    <h2>Challenges Front-End Developers faces</h2>
        <p id="fifth-paragraph"><b>Front-end developers</b> face numerous daily challenges, and managing client expectations is one of the biggest ones. 
        Clients often have a specific vision for their website, and it's up to front-end developers to bring that vision to life.
        However, clients may not always understand the technical limitations of web development, which can lead to unrealistic 
        expectations.<br><br>
        <b>Educating</b> the client is another challenge faced by front-end developers. Clients may request features that are
        technically impossible or that would harm the user experience. It's up to front-end developers to explain these 
        limitations and suggest alternative solutions that meet the client's needs while also ensuring a positive user 
        experience.
        </p>
